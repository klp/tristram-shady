and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was either clapp&rsquo;d, or spavin&rsquo;d, or greaz&rsquo;d;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or he was twitter-bon&rsquo;d, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him, which <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> let him carry no flesh;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and a good horse to purchase in his stead.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What the loss on such a balance might amount to,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">communibus annis</span><span class="c0 c2">, I&nbsp;<a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but let it be what it <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a>, the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> weighing the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> do ten times as much good;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his charity into <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the least&nbsp;17wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nothing for the aged,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt together.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> any application whatever,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or else&nbsp;be content to ride the last poor devil, such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to the very end of the chapter.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">As he dreaded his own constancy in the first<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he very chearfully betook himself to the second; and though he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> very well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a&nbsp;panegyrick&nbsp;<a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> himself.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">La Mancha</span><span class="c0 c2">, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I&nbsp;love more, and <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of antiquity.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>For you must know, that so long as this explanation <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> have done the parson credit,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>the devil a soul <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> find it out,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>I&nbsp;suppose his enemies <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> not, and that his friends <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> not.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary&rsquo;s licence to set her up,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but the whole secret came out;

The first twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself, and indeed my mother too, about the cursed expence, which he said might every shilling of it have been saved;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>then what vexed him more than everything else was, the provoking time of the year,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which, as I told you, was towards the end of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">September</span><span class="c0">, when his wall-fruit and green gages especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for pulling:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&ldquo;Had he been whistled up to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">London</span><span class="c0">, <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Tom Fool&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;errand, in any other month of the whole year</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c4">he should not have said three words about&nbsp;it</span><span class="c0 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">For the next two whole stages, no subject <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> go down, but the heavy blow he had sustain&rsquo;d from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully reckon&rsquo;d <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> in his mind, and register&rsquo;d down in his pocket-book, as a second staff for his old age, in case&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Bobby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;should fail him. The disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man, than all the money which the journey, etc., had cost him, put together,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>rot the hundred and twenty pounds,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he did not mind it a rush.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">From&nbsp;</span><span class="c0

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>of which, in the satirical vehemence of his wit, now sharpen&rsquo;d a little by vexation, he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> give so many humorous and provoking descriptions,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and place his rib and&nbsp;33self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregation;<span

word&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">weakness</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;was uttered, and struck full <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> his brain<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so sure it set him <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> running divisions <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> how many kinds of weaknesses there were;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that there was such a thing as weakness of the body,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as well as weakness of the mind,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and then he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of all these vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">In short, he had so many little subjects of </span><span class="c0 c4">disquietude springing out of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>In a word, as she complained to my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">, he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> have tired out the patience of </span><span class="c0 c4">any

class="c0">&nbsp;my father travelled homewards, as I told you, in none of the best of moods,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>pshawing and pishing all the way down,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>yet he had the complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to himself;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which was the resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice, which my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;clause in the marriage-settlement empowered him; nor was it till the very night in which </span><span class="c0 c4">I was begot</span><span class="c0 c2">, which was thirteen months after, that she had the least intimation of his design: when my father, happening, as you remember, to be a little chagrin&rsquo;d and out of temper,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over what was to come,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> to the bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds;&nbsp;34which was to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year&rsquo;s journey.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">My father was a gentleman of many virtues,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but he had a strong spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add to the number.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good cause,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my mother had so much knowledge, that she knew &rsquo;twas to no purpose to make any remonstrance,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so she e&rsquo;en resolved to sit down quietly</span><span class="c0 c4">, and make the most of&nbsp;it.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.qddpt2gogyg"><span>CHAPTER XVIII</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">the point was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that night agreed, or rather determined, that my mother should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her eyes <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Manningham</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her mind,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five shillings book <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the f&oelig;tus in cross births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I&nbsp;say, was absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul&rsquo;s hand but this old woman&rsquo;s only.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>Now this I like;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>when we cannot get at the very thing we wish<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>never to take up with the next best in degree to it:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>no; that&rsquo;s pitiful beyond description;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it is no more than a week from this very day, in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the world;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which is&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">March</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;9, 1759,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that my dear, dear&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Jenny</span><span class="c0 c2">, observing I looked a little grave, as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty shillings a yard,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much trouble;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of tenpence a yard.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis the duplication of <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> and the same greatness of soul; only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother&rsquo;s case, was, that she <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> in her&nbsp;35situation might have wished, because the old widwife had really some little claim to be depended <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a>,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much, at least, as success <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish, brought every mother&rsquo;s son of them into the world without any <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> slip or accident which <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> fairly be laid to her account.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">These facts, tho&rsquo; they had their weight, yet did not altogether satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> my father&rsquo;s spirits in relation to this choice.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>To say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justice<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love, all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kind;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he felt himself concerned in a particular manner, that all should go right in the present case;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>from the accumulated sorrow he lay open to, should any evil betide his wife and child in lying-in at&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Shandy-Hall</span><span class="c0">.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>He knew the world judged by events, and <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> add to his afflictions in such a misfortune, by loading him with the whole blame of it.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&ldquo;Alas, o&rsquo;day;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>had Mrs.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Shandy</span><span class="c0">, poor gentlewoman! had but her wish in going up to town just to lye-in and come down again;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which, they say, she begged and prayed for <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> her bare knees,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and which, in my opinion, considering the fortune which Mr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Shandy</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;got with her,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>was no such mighty matter to have complied with, the lady and her babe might both of them have been alive at this hour.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">This exclamation, my father knew, was unanswerable;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and yet, it was not merely to shelter himself,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nor was it altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about this point;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>my father had extensive views of things,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and stood moreover, as he thought, deeply concerned in it for the publick good, from the dread he entertained of the bad uses an ill-fated instance might be put&nbsp;to.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">He was very sensible that all political writers <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> the subject had unanimously agreed and lamented, from the beginning of Queen&nbsp;</span><span class="c0

metaphor, and he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> run it down into a perfect allegory, by maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural where the

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>a stoppage of circulation must ensue, which was death in both cases.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">There was little danger, he <a href="#modal-2"

class="c0">&nbsp;invasions;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nor was he so much in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our constitution, which he hoped was not so bad as it was imagined;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but he verily feared, that in some violent push, we should go off, all at once, in a state-apoplexy;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and then he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> say,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">The Lord have mercy <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> us all</span><span class="c0 c2">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">My father was never able to give the history of this distemper,<span

Les Th&eacute;ologiens posent d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute; pour principe, que le bapt&ecirc;me, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance; il faut &ecirc;tre n&eacute; dans le monde, pour rena&icirc;tre en&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Jesus Christ</span><span class="c0 c1">, comme ils l&rsquo;enseignent.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">S.&nbsp;Thomas, 3&nbsp;part, qu&aelig;st. 88, artic.

Le concours des th&eacute;ologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les r&eacute;gles des dioc&eacute;ses, paroit former une autorit&eacute; qui termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, que le raisonnement des th&eacute;ologiens est uniquement fond&eacute; sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l&rsquo;on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d&rsquo;un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, considerant que les m&ecirc;mes th&eacute;ologiens enseignent, que l&rsquo;on peut risquer les sacremens que&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Jesus Christ</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;a &eacute;tablis comme des moyens faciles, mais n&eacute;cessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; &amp; d&rsquo;ailleurs estimant, que les enfans renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient &ecirc;tre capables de salut, parcequ&rsquo;ils sont capables de damnation;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>pour ces considerations, &amp; en egard &agrave; l&rsquo;expos&eacute;, suivant lequel on&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">46</span><span class="c0 c1 c10">assure avoir trouv&eacute; un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s, sans faire aucun tort &agrave; la mere, le Conseil estime que l&rsquo;on pourroit se servir du moyen propos&eacute;, dans la confiance qu&rsquo;il a, que Dieu n&rsquo;a point laiss&eacute; ces sortes d&rsquo;enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp; supposant, comme il est expos&eacute;, que le moyen dont il s&rsquo;agit est propre &agrave; leur procurer le bapt&ecirc;me; cependant comme il s&rsquo;agiroit, en autorisant la pratique propos&eacute;e, de changer une regie universellement &eacute;tablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; &agrave; qui il appartient de juger de l&rsquo;utilit&eacute;, &amp; du danger du moyen propos&eacute;, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l&rsquo;ev&ecirc;que, le Conseil estime qu&rsquo;il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d&rsquo;expliquer les r&eacute;gles de l&rsquo;eglise, &amp; d&rsquo;y d&eacute;roger dans le cas, ou la loi ne s&ccedil;auroit obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la mani&eacute;re de baptiser dont il s&rsquo;agit, le Conseil ne pourroit l&rsquo;approuver sans le concours de ces deux autorit&eacute;s. On conseile au moins &agrave; celui qui consulte, de s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; de lui faire part de la presente d&eacute;cision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign&eacute;s s&rsquo;appuyent, il puisse &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; dans le cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, ou il risqueroit trop d&rsquo;attendre que la permission f&ucirc;t demand&eacute;e &amp; accord&eacute;e d&rsquo;employer le moyen qu&rsquo;il propose si avantageux au salut de l&rsquo;enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l&rsquo;on pourroit s&rsquo;en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il s&rsquo;agit, venoient au monde, contre l&rsquo;esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du m&ecirc;me moyen, il seroit n&eacute;cessaire de les baptiser sous condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme &agrave; tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le bapt&ecirc;me d&rsquo;un enfant qui fait paro&icirc;tre quelque partie de son corps, enjoignent n&eacute;antmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s&rsquo;il vient heureusement au monde.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Deliber&eacute; en&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Sorbonne</span><span class="c0">, le 10&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Avril</span><span class="c0 c2">, 1733.</span></p><p class="c5 c13"><span class="c0 c2">A.

and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was either clapp&rsquo;d, or spavin&rsquo;d, or greaz&rsquo;d;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or he was twitter-bon&rsquo;d, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him, which <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> let him carry no flesh;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and a good horse to purchase in his stead.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What the loss on such a balance might amount to,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">communibus annis</span><span class="c0 c2">, I&nbsp;<a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but let it be what it <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a>, the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> weighing the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> do ten times as much good;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his charity into <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> particular ch<a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">Anne</a>l, and where, as he fancied, it was the least&nbsp;17wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nothing for the aged,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt together.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> any application whatever,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or else&nbsp;be content to ride the last poor devil, such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to the very end of the chapter.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">As he dreaded his own constancy in the first<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he very chearfully betook himself to the second; and though he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> very well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a&nbsp;panegyrick&nbsp;<a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> himself.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">La Mancha</span><span class="c0 c2">, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I&nbsp;love more, and <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of antiquity.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>For you must know, that so long as this explanation <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> have done the parson credit,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>the devil a soul <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> find it out,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>I&nbsp;suppose his enemies <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> not, and that his friends <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> not.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary&rsquo;s licence to set her up,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but the whole secret came out;

observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refined parts;

fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1"><a href="#modal-bbox" rel="modal:open">Yorick</a></span><span class="c0 c1">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;extraction, who, by what I can remember of him, and by all the accounts I <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> ever get of him, seemed not to have had <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> single drop of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Danish</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;blood in his whole crasis;

to be a little chagrin&rsquo;d and out of temper,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over

rel="modal:open">could</a> to the bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds;&nbsp;34which was to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year&rsquo;s journey.</span></p><p

which might, or might not, add to the number.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good cause,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a> had so much knowledge, that she knew &rsquo;twas to no purpose to make any remonstrance,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so

rel="modal:open">mother</a> should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her eyes <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Manningham</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her mind,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five shillings book <a

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the f&oelig;tus in cross births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a>, I&nbsp;say, was absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul&rsquo;s

description;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it is no more than a week from this very day, in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the world;<span

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much trouble;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of tenpence a yard.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis the duplication of <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> and the same greatness of soul; only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a>&rsquo;s case, was, that she <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as <a

rel="modal:open">upon</a>,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much, at least, as success <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> give her; having, in the course of her practice of near

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>To say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justice<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love, all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kind;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he felt himself concerned in a particular m<a

Le concours des th&eacute;ologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les r&eacute;gles des dioc&eacute;ses, paroit former une autorit&eacute; qui termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, que le raisonnement des th&eacute;ologiens est uniquement fond&eacute; sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l&rsquo;on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d&rsquo;un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, considerant que les m&ecirc;mes th&eacute;ologiens enseignent, que l&rsquo;on peut risquer les sacremens que&nbsp;</span><span class="c0"><a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">Jesus</a> Christ</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;a &eacute;tablis comme des moyens faciles, mais n&eacute;cessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; &amp; d&rsquo;ailleurs estimant, que les enfans renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient &ecirc;tre capables de salut, parcequ&rsquo;ils sont capables de damnation;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>pour ces considerations, &amp; en egard &agrave; l&rsquo;expos&eacute;, suivant lequel on&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">46</span><span class="c0 c1 c10">assure avoir trouv&eacute; un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s, sans faire aucun tort &agrave; la mere, le Conseil estime que l&rsquo;on pourroit se servir du moyen propos&eacute;, dans la confiance qu&rsquo;il a, que Dieu n&rsquo;a point laiss&eacute; ces sortes d&rsquo;enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp; supposant, comme il est expos&eacute;, que le moyen dont il s&rsquo;agit est propre &agrave; leur procurer le bapt&ecirc;me; cependant comme il s&rsquo;agiroit, en autorisant la pratique propos&eacute;e, de changer une regie universellement &eacute;tablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; &agrave; qui il appartient de juger de l&rsquo;utilit&eacute;, &amp; du danger du moyen propos&eacute;, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l&rsquo;ev&ecirc;que, le Conseil estime qu&rsquo;il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d&rsquo;expliquer les r&eacute;gles de l&rsquo;eglise, &amp; d&rsquo;y d&eacute;roger dans le cas, ou la loi ne s&ccedil;auroit obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la mani&eacute;re de baptiser dont il s&rsquo;agit, le Conseil ne pourroit l&rsquo;approuver sans le concours de ces deux autorit&eacute;s. On conseile au moins &agrave; celui qui consulte, de s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; de lui faire part de la presente d&eacute;cision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign&eacute;s s&rsquo;appuyent, il puisse &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; dans le cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, ou il risqueroit trop d&rsquo;attendre que la permission f&ucirc;t demand&eacute;e &amp; accord&eacute;e d&rsquo;employer le moyen qu&rsquo;il propose si avantageux au salut de l&rsquo;enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l&rsquo;on pourroit s&rsquo;en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il s&rsquo;agit, venoient au monde, contre l&rsquo;esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du m&ecirc;me moyen, il seroit n&eacute;cessaire de les baptiser sous condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme &agrave; tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le bapt&ecirc;me d&rsquo;un enfant qui fait paro&icirc;tre quelque partie de son corps, enjoignent n&eacute;antmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s&rsquo;il vient heureusement au monde.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Deliber&eacute; en&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Sorbonne</span><span class="c0">, le 10&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Avril</span><span class="c0 c2">, 1733.</span></p><p class="c5 c13"><span class="c0 c2">A.

and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was either clapp&rsquo;d, or spavin&rsquo;d, or greaz&rsquo;d;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or he was twitter-bon&rsquo;d, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him, which <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> let him carry no flesh;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and a good horse to purchase in his stead.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What the loss on such a balance might amount to,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">communibus annis</span><span class="c0 c2">, I&nbsp;<a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a> leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but let it be what it <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">would</a>, the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> weighing the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> do ten times as much good;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his charity into <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> particular ch<a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">Anne</a>l, and where, as he fancied, it was the least&nbsp;17wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish;

observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refined parts;

The disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man, than all the money which the journey, etc., had cost him, put together,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>rot the hundred and

to be a little chagrin&rsquo;d and out of temper,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over

rel="modal:open">could</a> to the bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds;&nbsp;34which was to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year&rsquo;s journey.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">My <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">father</a> was a gentleman of many virtues,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but he had a strong spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add to the number.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good cause,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a> had so much knowledge, that she knew &rsquo;twas to no purpose to make any remonstrance,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so she e&rsquo;en resolved to sit down quietly</span><span class="c0 c4">, and make the most of&nbsp;it.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.qddpt2gogyg"><span>CHAPTER XVIII</span></h2><p class="c3"><span

rel="modal:open">mother</a> should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her eyes <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Manningham</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her mind,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five shillings book <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">upon</a> the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the f&oelig;tus in cross births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a>, I&nbsp;say, was absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul&rsquo;s

description;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it is no more than a week from this very day, in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the world;<span

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much trouble;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of tenpence a yard.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis the duplication of <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> and the same greatness of soul; only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a>&rsquo;s case, was, that she <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as <a

rel="modal:open">upon</a>,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much, at least, as success <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">could</a> give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish, brought every <a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">mother</a>&rsquo;s son of them into the world without any <a href="#modal-2" rel="modal:open">one</a> slip or accident

class="show-word">&mdash;</span>To say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justice<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love, all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kind;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he felt himself concerned in a particular m<a

Le concours des th&eacute;ologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les r&eacute;gles des dioc&eacute;ses, paroit former une autorit&eacute; qui termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, que le raisonnement des th&eacute;ologiens est uniquement fond&eacute; sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l&rsquo;on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d&rsquo;un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, considerant que les m&ecirc;mes th&eacute;ologiens enseignent, que l&rsquo;on peut risquer les sacremens que&nbsp;</span><span class="c0"><a href="#modal-3" rel="modal:open">Jesus</a> Christ</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;a &eacute;tablis comme des moyens faciles, mais n&eacute;cessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; &amp; d&rsquo;ailleurs estimant, que les enfans renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient &ecirc;tre capables de salut, parcequ&rsquo;ils sont capables de damnation;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>pour ces considerations, &amp; en egard &agrave; l&rsquo;expos&eacute;, suivant lequel on&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">46</span><span class="c0 c1 c10">assure avoir trouv&eacute; un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s, sans faire aucun tort &agrave; la mere, le Conseil estime que l&rsquo;on pourroit se servir du moyen propos&eacute;, dans la confiance qu&rsquo;il a, que Dieu n&rsquo;a point laiss&eacute; ces sortes d&rsquo;enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp; supposant, comme il est expos&eacute;, que le moyen dont il s&rsquo;agit est propre &agrave; leur procurer le bapt&ecirc;me; cependant comme il s&rsquo;agiroit, en autorisant la pratique propos&eacute;e, de changer une regie universellement &eacute;tablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; &agrave; qui il appartient de juger de l&rsquo;utilit&eacute;, &amp; du danger du moyen propos&eacute;, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l&rsquo;ev&ecirc;que, le Conseil estime qu&rsquo;il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d&rsquo;expliquer les r&eacute;gles de l&rsquo;eglise, &amp; d&rsquo;y d&eacute;roger dans le cas, ou la loi ne s&ccedil;auroit obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la mani&eacute;re de baptiser dont il s&rsquo;agit, le Conseil ne pourroit l&rsquo;approuver sans le concours de ces deux autorit&eacute;s. On conseile au moins &agrave; celui qui consulte, de s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; de lui faire part de la presente d&eacute;cision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign&eacute;s s&rsquo;appuyent, il puisse &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; dans le cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, ou il risqueroit trop d&rsquo;attendre que la permission f&ucirc;t demand&eacute;e &amp; accord&eacute;e d&rsquo;employer le moyen qu&rsquo;il propose si avantageux au salut de l&rsquo;enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l&rsquo;on pourroit s&rsquo;en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il s&rsquo;agit, venoient au monde, contre l&rsquo;esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du m&ecirc;me moyen, il seroit n&eacute;cessaire de les baptiser sous condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme &agrave; tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le bapt&ecirc;me d&rsquo;un enfant qui fait paro&icirc;tre quelque partie de son corps, enjoignent n&eacute;antmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s&rsquo;il vient heureusement au monde.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Deliber&eacute; en&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Sorbonne</span><span class="c0">, le 10&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Avril</span><span class="c0 c2">, 1733.</span></p><p class="c5 c13"><span class="c0 c2">A.

d&rsquo;or</span><span class="c0 c2">,&mdash;all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed bridle, ornamented at all points as it should be.&mdash;&mdash;But not caring to banter his beast, he had hung all these up behind his study door:&mdash;and, in lieu of them, had seriously&nbsp;15befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle, as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring visits to the gentry who lived around him,&mdash;you will easily comprehend, that the parson, so appointed, would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting. To speak the truth, he never could enter a village, but he caught the attention of both old and young.&mdash;&mdash;Labour stood still as he pass&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well,&mdash;&mdash;the spinning-wheel forgot its round,&mdash;&mdash;even chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as his movement was not of the quickest, he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observations,&mdash;to hear the groans of the serious,&mdash;and the laughter of the light-hearted;&mdash;all which he bore with excellent tranquillity.&mdash;His character was,&mdash;he loved a jest in his heart&mdash;and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule, he would say he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself: So that to his friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money, and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour,&mdash;instead of giving the true cause,&mdash;he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself; and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones, being altogether as spare a figure as his beast,&mdash;he would sometimes insist upon it, that the horse was as good as the rider deserved;&mdash;that they were, centaur-like,&mdash;both of a piece. At other times, and in other moods, when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit,&mdash;he would say, he found himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse, without a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to keep himself in countenance, but in spirits.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons for riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse, preferably to one of mettle;&mdash;for on such a one he could sit mechanically, and meditate as delightfully&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">de vanitate mundi et fug&acirc; s&aelig;culi</span><span class="c0 c2">, as with the advantage of a death&rsquo;s-head before him;&mdash;that, in all other exercitations, he could spend his time, as he rode slowly along,&mdash;to as much account as in his study;&mdash;that he could draw up an argument in his sermon,&mdash;or a hole in his breeches, as steadily on the one as in the other;&mdash;that brisk&nbsp;16trotting and slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible movements.&mdash;But that upon his steed&mdash;he could unite and reconcile every thing,&mdash;he could compose his sermon&mdash;he could compose his cough,&mdash;&mdash;and, in case nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to sleep.&mdash;In short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but the true cause,&mdash;and he with-held the true one, only out of a nicety of temper, because he thought it did honour to him.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of this gentleman&rsquo;s life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or vanity, or call it what you will,&mdash;to run into the opposite extreme.&mdash;In the language of the county where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good horse, and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling; and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,&mdash;it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last,&mdash;as much as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was either clapp&rsquo;d, or spavin&rsquo;d, or greaz&rsquo;d;&mdash;or he was twitter-bon&rsquo;d, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him, which would let him carry no flesh;&mdash;so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,&mdash;and a good horse to purchase in his stead.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What the loss on such a balance might amount to,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">communibus annis</span><span class="c0 c2">, I&nbsp;would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;&mdash;but let it be what it would, the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he could do ten times as much good;&mdash;and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the least&nbsp;17wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,&mdash;nothing for the aged,&mdash;nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt together.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;&mdash;and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed upon any application whatever,&mdash;or else&nbsp;be content to ride the last poor devil, such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to the very end of the chapter.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">As he dreaded his own constancy in the first&mdash;he very chearfully betook himself to the second; and though he could very well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,&mdash;yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a&nbsp;panegyrick&nbsp;upon himself.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">La Mancha</span><span class="c0 c2">, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I&nbsp;love more, and would actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of antiquity.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.&mdash;For you must know, that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit,&mdash;the devil a soul could find it out,&mdash;I&nbsp;suppose his enemies would not, and that his friends could not.&mdash;&mdash;But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary&rsquo;s licence to set her up,&mdash;but the whole secret came out; every horse he had lost, and two horses more than ever he had lost, with all the circumstances of their destruction, were known and distinctly remembered.&mdash;The story ran like wild-fire&mdash;&ldquo;The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if it was so, &rsquo;twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he would pocket the expence of the licence, ten times told, the very first year:&mdash;So that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What were his views in this, and in every other action of his&nbsp;18life,&mdash;or rather what were the opinions which </span><span class="c0 c4">floated in the brains of other people</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;concerning it, was a thought which too much floated in his own, and too often broke in upon his rest, when he should have been sound asleep.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy upon that score,&mdash;it being just so long since he left his parish,&mdash;and the whole world at the same time behind him,&mdash;and stands accountable to a Judge of whom he will have no cause to complain.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order them as they will, they pass thro&rsquo; a&nbsp;certain medium, which so twists and refracts them from their true directions&mdash;&mdash;that, with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are nevertheless forced to live and die without&nbsp;it.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful example.&mdash;&mdash;But to know by what means this came to pass,&mdash;and to make that knowledge of use to you,&nbsp;I&nbsp;insist upon it that you read the two following chapters, which contain such a sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along with it.&mdash;When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way</span><span class="c0 c4">, we will go on</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;with the midwife.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.xko0mod62ju2"><span>CHAPTER XI</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c4">Yorick</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;was this parson&rsquo;s name, and, what is very remarkable in it (as&nbsp;appears from a most ancient account of the family, wrote upon strong vellum, and now in perfect preservation) it had been exactly so spelt for near,&mdash;&mdash;I&nbsp;was within an ace of saying nine hundred years;&mdash;&mdash;but I would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth, however indisputable in itself;&mdash;&mdash;and therefore I shall content myself with only saying&mdash;&mdash;It had been exactly so spelt, without the&nbsp;least variation or transposition of a single letter, for I do not know how long;

With all this sail, poor&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Yorick</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;carried not one ounce of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world; and, at the age of twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his course in it, as a romping, unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that upon his first setting out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul ten times in a day of somebody&rsquo;s tackling; and as the grave and more slow-paced were oftenest in his way,&mdash;&mdash;you may likewise imagine, &rsquo;twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled. For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Fracas</span><span class="c0">:&mdash;&mdash;For, to speak the truth,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Yorick</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity;&mdash;not to gravity as such;&mdash;for where gravity was wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks together;&mdash;but he was an enemy to the affectation of it, and declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it fell in his way, however sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much quarter.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say that Gravity was an errant scoundrel, and he would add,&mdash;of the most dangerous kind too,&mdash;because a sly one; and that he verily believed, more honest, well-meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month, than by pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered, he would say, there was no danger,&mdash;but to itself:&mdash;whereas the very essence of gravity was&nbsp;21design, and consequently deceit;&mdash;&rsquo;twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,&mdash;it was no better, but often worse, than what a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">French</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wit had long ago defined it,&mdash;</span><span class="c0 c1">viz.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind</span><span class="c0">;&mdash;which definition of gravity,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Yorick</span><span class="c0 c2">, with great imprudence, would say, deserved to be wrote in letters of gold.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Yorick</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;had no impression but one, and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression he would usually translate into plain&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">English</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;without any periphrasis;&mdash;and too oft without much distinction of either person, time, or place;&mdash;so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an ungenerous proceeding&mdash;&mdash;he never gave himself a moment&rsquo;s time to reflect who was the hero of the piece,&mdash;&mdash;what his station,&mdash;&mdash;or how far he had power to hurt him hereafter;&mdash;&mdash;but if it was a dirty action,&mdash;without more ado,&mdash;The man was a dirty fellow,&mdash;and so on.&mdash;And as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">bon mot</span><span class="c0">, or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or humour of expression, it gave wings to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Yorick</span><span class="c0 c1">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;indiscretion. In a word, tho&rsquo; he never sought, yet, at the same time, as he seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without much ceremony;&mdash;&mdash;he had but too many temptations in life, of scattering his wit and his humour,&mdash;his gibes and his jests about him.&mdash;&mdash;They were not lost for want of gathering.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What were the consequences, and what was&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Yorick</span><span class="c0 c1">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;catastrophe thereupon, you will read in the next chapter.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.7hpdnmak8mdn"><span>CHAPTER XII</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Mortgager</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Mortgag&eacute;e</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;differ the one from the other, not more in length of purse, than the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Jester</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Jest&eacute;e</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;do, in that of memory.

To speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Eugenius&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted thro&rsquo; any malignancy;&mdash;but, on the contrary, from an honesty of mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cross&rsquo;d out in course.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c1">Eugenius</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add, in an accent of sorrowful apprehension,&mdash;to the uttermost mite.

The fact was this, That in the latter end of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">September</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;1717, which was the year before I was born, my mother having carried my father up to town much against the grain,&mdash;he peremptorily insisted upon the clause;&mdash;so that I was doom&rsquo;d, by marriage-articles, to have my nose squeez&rsquo;d as flat to my face, as if the destinies had actually spun me without one.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">How this event came about,&mdash;and what a train of vexatious disappointments, in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me from the mere loss, or rather compression, of this one single member,&mdash;shall be laid before the reader all in due time.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.23wlz6tcj6ww"><span class="c7 c2">CHAPTER XVI</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">My</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;father, as anybody may naturally imagine, came down with my mother into the country, in but a pettish kind of a humour. The first twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself, and indeed my mother too, about the cursed expence, which he said might every shilling of it have been saved;&mdash;then what vexed him more than everything else was, the provoking time of the year,&mdash;which, as I told you, was towards the end of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">September</span><span class="c0">, when his wall-fruit and green gages especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for pulling:&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Had he been whistled up to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">London</span><span class="c0">, upon a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Tom Fool&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;errand, in any other month of the whole year</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c4">he should not have said three words about&nbsp;it</span><span class="c0 c2">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the heavy blow he had sustain&rsquo;d from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully reckon&rsquo;d upon in his mind, and register&rsquo;d down in his pocket-book, as a second staff for his old age, in case&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Bobby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;should fail him. The disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man, than all the money which the journey, etc., had cost him, put together,&mdash;rot the hundred and twenty pounds,&mdash;&mdash;he did not mind it a rush.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">From&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Stilton</span><span class="c0">, all the way to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Grantham</span><span class="c0">, nothing in the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends, and the foolish figure they should both make at church, the first&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Sunday</span><span class="c0 c2">;&mdash;&mdash;of which, in the satirical vehemence of his wit, now sharpen&rsquo;d a little by vexation, he would give so many humorous and provoking descriptions,&mdash;and place his rib and&nbsp;33self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregation;&mdash;that my mother declared, these two stages were so truly tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from one end to the other of them all the way.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">From&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Grantham</span><span class="c0">, till they had cross&rsquo;d the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Trent</span><span class="c0">, my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in this affair&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he would say to himself, over and over again, &ldquo;the woman could not be deceived herself&mdash;&mdash;if she could,&mdash;&mdash;what weakness!&rdquo;&mdash;tormenting word!&mdash;which led his imagination a thorny dance, and, before all was over, play&rsquo;d the duce and all with him;&mdash;&mdash;for sure as ever the word&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">weakness</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;was uttered, and struck full upon his brain&mdash;so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses there were;&mdash;&mdash;that there was such a thing as weakness of the body,&mdash;&mdash;as well as weakness of the mind,&mdash;and then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of all these vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">In short, he had so many little subjects of </span><span class="c0 c4">disquietude springing out of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this one affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down.&mdash;&mdash;In a word, as she complained to my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">, he would have tired out the patience of </span><span class="c0 c4">any flesh</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;alive.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.wf17bevswxao"><span class="c7 c2">CHAPTER XVII</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Though</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;my father travelled homewards, as I told you, in none of the best of moods,&mdash;pshawing and pishing all the way down,&mdash;yet he had the complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to himself;&mdash;which was the resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice, which my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;clause in the marriage-settlement empowered him; nor was it till the very night in which </span><span class="c0 c4">I was begot</span><span class="c0 c2">, which was thirteen months after, that she had the least intimation of his design: when my father, happening, as you remember, to be a little chagrin&rsquo;d and out of temper,&mdash;&mdash;took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over what was to come,&mdash;&mdash;to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds;&nbsp;34which was to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year&rsquo;s journey.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">My father was a gentleman of many virtues,&mdash;but he had a strong spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add to the number.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good cause,&mdash;and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my mother had so much knowledge, that she knew &rsquo;twas to no purpose to make any remonstrance,&mdash;so she e&rsquo;en resolved to sit down quietly</span><span class="c0 c4">, and make the most of&nbsp;it.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.qddpt2gogyg"><span>CHAPTER XVIII</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">the point was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that night agreed, or rather determined, that my mother should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Manningham</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her mind,&mdash;&mdash;notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,&mdash;&mdash;but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the f&oelig;tus in cross births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I&nbsp;say, was absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul&rsquo;s hand but this old woman&rsquo;s only.&mdash;Now this I like;&mdash;when we cannot get at the very thing we wish&mdash;&mdash;never to take up with the next best in degree to it:&mdash;no; that&rsquo;s pitiful beyond description;&mdash;it is no more than a week from this very day, in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the world;&mdash;which is&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">March</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;9, 1759,&mdash;&mdash;that my dear, dear&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4 c1">Jenny</span><span class="c0 c2">, observing I looked a little grave, as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty shillings a yard,&mdash;told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much trouble;&mdash;and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of tenpence a yard.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul; only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother&rsquo;s case, was, that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as one in her&nbsp;35situation might have wished, because the old widwife had really some little claim to be depended upon,&mdash;as much, at least, as success could give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish, brought every mother&rsquo;s son of them into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her account.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">These facts, tho&rsquo;

Les Th&eacute;ologiens posent d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute; pour principe, que le bapt&ecirc;me, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance; il faut &ecirc;tre n&eacute; dans le monde, pour rena&icirc;tre en&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Jesus Christ</span><span class="c0 c1">, comme ils l&rsquo;enseignent.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">S.&nbsp;Thomas, 3&nbsp;part, qu&aelig;st. 88, artic.

Le concours des th&eacute;ologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les r&eacute;gles des dioc&eacute;ses, paroit former une autorit&eacute; qui termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, que le raisonnement des th&eacute;ologiens est uniquement fond&eacute; sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l&rsquo;on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d&rsquo;un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, considerant que les m&ecirc;mes th&eacute;ologiens enseignent, que l&rsquo;on peut risquer les sacremens que&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Jesus Christ</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;a &eacute;tablis comme des moyens faciles, mais n&eacute;cessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; &amp; d&rsquo;ailleurs estimant, que les enfans renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient &ecirc;tre capables de salut, parcequ&rsquo;ils sont capables de damnation;&mdash;pour ces considerations, &amp; en egard &agrave; l&rsquo;expos&eacute;, suivant lequel on&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">46</span><span class="c0 c1 c10">assure avoir trouv&eacute; un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s, sans faire aucun tort &agrave; la mere, le Conseil estime que l&rsquo;on pourroit se servir du moyen propos&eacute;, dans la confiance qu&rsquo;il a, que Dieu n&rsquo;a point laiss&eacute; ces sortes d&rsquo;enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp; supposant, comme il est expos&eacute;, que le moyen dont il s&rsquo;agit est propre &agrave; leur procurer le bapt&ecirc;me; cependant comme il s&rsquo;agiroit, en autorisant la pratique propos&eacute;e, de changer une regie universellement &eacute;tablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; &agrave; qui il appartient de juger de l&rsquo;utilit&eacute;, &amp; du danger du moyen propos&eacute;, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l&rsquo;ev&ecirc;que, le Conseil estime qu&rsquo;il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d&rsquo;expliquer les r&eacute;gles de l&rsquo;eglise, &amp; d&rsquo;y d&eacute;roger dans le cas, ou la loi ne s&ccedil;auroit obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la mani&eacute;re de baptiser dont il s&rsquo;agit, le Conseil ne pourroit l&rsquo;approuver sans le concours de ces deux autorit&eacute;s. On conseile au moins &agrave; celui qui consulte, de s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; de lui faire part de la presente d&eacute;cision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign&eacute;s s&rsquo;appuyent, il puisse &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; dans le cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, ou il risqueroit trop d&rsquo;attendre que la permission f&ucirc;t demand&eacute;e &amp; accord&eacute;e d&rsquo;employer le moyen qu&rsquo;il propose si avantageux au salut de l&rsquo;enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l&rsquo;on pourroit s&rsquo;en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il s&rsquo;agit, venoient au monde, contre l&rsquo;esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du m&ecirc;me moyen, il seroit n&eacute;cessaire de les baptiser sous condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme &agrave; tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le bapt&ecirc;me d&rsquo;un enfant qui fait paro&icirc;tre quelque partie de son corps, enjoignent n&eacute;antmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s&rsquo;il vient heureusement au monde.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">Deliber&eacute; en&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Sorbonne</span><span class="c0">, le 10&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Avril</span><span class="c0 c2">, 1733.</span></p><p class="c5 c13"><span class="c0 c2">A.

One would have thought, that the whole force of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at first,&mdash;as is generally the case.&mdash;But nothing ever wrought with our family after the ordinary way. Possibly at the very time this happened, it might have something else to afflict it; and as afflictions are sent down for our good, and that as this had never done the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Shandy Family</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;any good at all, it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an opportunity to discharge its office.&mdash;&mdash;Observe, I&nbsp;determine nothing upon this.&mdash;&mdash;My way is ever to point out to the curious, different tracts of investigation, to come at the first springs of the events I tell;&mdash;not with a pedantic&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Fescue</span><span class="c0">,&mdash;or in the decisive manner of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Tacitus</span><span class="c0 c2">, who outwits himself and his reader;&mdash;but with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the inquisitive;&mdash;to them I write,&mdash;&mdash;and by them I shall be read,&mdash;&mdash;if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long,&mdash;to the very end of the world.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father and uncle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what direction it exerted itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them, after it began to operate, is what I am able to explain with great exactness, and is as follows:</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">My uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Toby Shandy</span><span class="c0">, Madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and rectitude,&mdash;&mdash;possessed one in a very eminent degree, which is seldom or never put into the catalogue; and that was a most extreme and unparallel&rsquo;d modesty of nature;&mdash;&mdash;though I correct the word nature, for this reason, that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing, and that is, Whether this modesty of his was natural or acquir&rsquo;d.&mdash;&mdash;Whichever way my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;came by it, &rsquo;twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it; and that is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in them,&mdash;but to things;&mdash;&mdash;and this kind of modesty so possessed him, and it arose to such a height in him, as almost&nbsp;50to equal, if such a thing could be, even the modesty of a woman: That female nicety, Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which makes you so much the awe of ours.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;had contracted all this from this very source;&mdash;that he had spent a great part of his time in converse with your sex; and that from a thorough knowledge of you, and the force of imitation which such fair examples render irresistible, he had acquired this amiable turn&nbsp;&nbsp;mind.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">I wish I could say so,&mdash;for unless it was with his sister-in-law, my father&rsquo;s wife and my mother&mdash;&mdash;my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many years;&mdash;no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.&mdash;&mdash;A&nbsp;blow!&mdash;Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke off by a ball from the parapet of a horn-work at the siege of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Namur</span><span class="c0">, which struck full upon my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;groin.&mdash;Which way could that effect it? The story of that, Madam, is long and interesting;&mdash;but it would be running my history all upon heaps to give it you here.&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;Tis for an episode hereafter; and every circumstance relating to it, in its proper place, shall be faithfully laid before you:&mdash;&rsquo;Till then, it is not in my power to give farther light into this matter, or say more than what I have said already,&mdash;&mdash;That my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was a gentleman of unparallel&rsquo;d modesty, which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family pride,&mdash;&mdash;they both so wrought together within him, that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Dinah</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;touch&rsquo;d upon, but with the greatest emotion.&mdash;&mdash;The least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face;&mdash;but when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies, which the illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to do,&mdash;the unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family, would set my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;honour and modesty o&rsquo;bleeding; and he would often take my father aside, in the greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell him, he would give him anything in the world, only to let the story rest.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">, that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done any thing in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir&rsquo;d of another, to have made my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;heart easy in this, or any other point. But this lay out of his power.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;My father, as I told you, was a philosopher in grain,&mdash;speculative,&mdash;systematical;&mdash;and my aunt&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Dinah&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;affair was a&nbsp;51matter of as much consequence to him, as the retrogradation of the planets to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Copernicus</span><span class="c0">:&mdash;The backslidings of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Venus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in her orbit fortified the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Copernican</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;system, called so after his name; and the backslidings of my aunt&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Dinah</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in her orbit, did the same service in establishing my father&rsquo;s system, which, I&nbsp;trust, will for ever hereafter be called the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Shandean System</span><span class="c0 c2">, after this.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice a sense of shame as any man whatever;&mdash;&mdash;and neither he, nor, I&nbsp;dare say,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Copernicus</span><span class="c0">, would have divulged the affair in either case, or have taken the least notice of it to the world, but for the obligations they owed, as they thought, to truth.&mdash;</span><span class="c0 c1">Amicus Plato</span><span class="c0">, my father would say, construing the words to my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">, as he went along,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Amicus Plato</span><span class="c0">; that is,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Dinah</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was my aunt;&mdash;</span><span class="c0 c1">sed magis amica veritas</span><span class="c0">&mdash;&mdash;but&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Truth</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;is my sister.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the source of many a fraternal squabble. The one could not bear to hear the tale of family disgrace recorded,&mdash;&mdash;and the other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at&nbsp;it.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">For God&rsquo;s sake, my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would cry,&mdash;&mdash;and for my sake, and for all our sakes, my dear brother&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Shandy</span><span class="c0">,&mdash;do let this story of our aunt&rsquo;s and her ashes sleep in peace;&mdash;&mdash;how can you,&mdash;&mdash;how can you have so little feeling and compassion for the character of our family?&mdash;&mdash;What is the character of a family to an hypothesis? my father would reply.&mdash;&mdash;Nay, if you come to that&mdash;what is the life of a family?&mdash;&mdash;The life of a family!&mdash;my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would say, throwing himself back in his arm chair, and lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one leg.&mdash;&mdash;Yes, the life,&mdash;&mdash;my father would say, maintaining his point. How many thousands of &rsquo;em are there every year that come cast away, (in&nbsp;all civilized countries at least)&mdash;&mdash;and considered as nothing but common air, in competition of an hypothesis. In my plain sense of things, my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would answer,&mdash;&mdash;every such instance is downright&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Murder</span><span class="c0">, let who will commit it.&mdash;&mdash;There lies your mistake, my father would reply;&mdash;&mdash;for, in&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Foro Scienti&aelig;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there is no such thing as&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Murder</span><span class="c0">,&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;tis only&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Death</span><span class="c0 c2">, brother.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">My uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would never offer to answer this by any other kind of argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Lillabullero</span><span class="c0 c2">.&mdash;&mdash;You must know it was the usual channel thro&rsquo; which his passions got vent, when any thing shocked or surprized him:&mdash;&mdash;but especially when any thing, which he deem&rsquo;d very absurd, was offered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">52</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon them, that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to this particular species of argument,&mdash;I&nbsp;here take the liberty to do it myself, for two reasons. First, That, in order to prevent all confusion in disputes, it may stand as much distinguished for ever, from every other species of argument&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;as the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Argumentum ad Verecundiam</span><span class="c0">,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">ex Absurdo, ex Fortiori</span><span class="c0">, or any other argument whatsoever:&mdash;&mdash;And, secondly, That it may be said by my children&rsquo;s children, when my head is laid to rest,&mdash;&mdash;that their learn&rsquo;d grandfather&rsquo;s head had been busied to as much purpose once, as other people&rsquo;s;&mdash;That he had invented a name,&mdash;and generously thrown it into the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Treasury</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Ars Logica</span><span class="c0 c2">, for one of the most unanswerable arguments in the whole science. And, if the end of disputation is more to silence than convince,&mdash;they may add, if they please, to one of the best arguments too.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">I do therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command, That it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Argumentum Fistulatorium</span><span class="c0">, and no other;&mdash;and that it rank hereafter with the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Argumentum Baculinum</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Argumentum ad Crumenam</span><span class="c0 c2">, and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same chapter.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">As for the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Argumentum Tripodium</span><span class="c0">, which is never used but by the woman against the man;&mdash;and the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Argumentum ad Rem</span><span class="c0">, which, contrarywise, is made use of by the man only against the woman;&mdash;As these two are enough in conscience for one lecture;&mdash;&mdash;and, moreover, as </span><span class="c0 c4">the one is the best answer to the other</span><span class="c0 c2">,&mdash;let them likewise be kept apart, and be treated of in a place by themselves.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.ldgmjanubnd1"><span class="c7 c2">CHAPTER XXII</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;learned Bishop&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Hall</span><span class="c0">, I mean the famous Dr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Joseph Hall</span><span class="c0">, who was Bishop of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Exeter</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in King&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">James</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the First&rsquo;s reign, tells us in one of his&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Decads</span><span class="c0">, at the end of his divine art of meditation, imprinted at&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">London</span><span class="c0">, in the year 1610, by&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">John Beal</span><span class="c0">, dwelling in&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Aldersgate-street</span><span class="c0 c2">, &ldquo;That it is an abominable thing for a man to commend himself;&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;and I really think it is&nbsp;so.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a masterly kind of a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found out;&mdash;I&nbsp;think it is full as abominable, that a man should lose the honour of it, and go out of the world with the conceit of it rotting in his head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">53</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">This is precisely my situation.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">For </span><span class="c0 c4">in this long digression</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which I was accidentally led into,&nbsp;as in all my </span><span class="c0 c4">digressions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(one only excepted) there is a masterstroke of </span><span class="c0 c4">digressive</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;skill, the merit of which has all along, I&nbsp;fear, been overlooked by my reader,&mdash;not for want of penetration in him,&mdash;but because &rsquo;tis an excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a </span><span class="c0 c4">digression</span><span class="c0">;&mdash;and it is this: That tho&rsquo; my </span><span class="c0 c4">digressions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are all fair, as you observe,&mdash;and that I fly off from what I am about, as far, and as often too, as any writer in&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Great Britain</span><span class="c0 c2">; yet I constantly take care to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my absence.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">I was just going, for example, to have given you the great outlines of my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;most whimsical character;&mdash;when my aunt&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Dinah</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the coachman came across us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system: Notwithstanding all this, you perceive that the drawing of my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;character went on gently all the time;&mdash;not the great contours of it,&mdash;that was impossible,&mdash;but some familiar strokes and faint designations of it, were here and there touch&rsquo;d on, as we went along, so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;now than you was before.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconciled, which were thought to be at variance with each other.

so that betwixt them both, all the tenements of their souls, from top to bottom, may be nothing else, for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary, but one fine transparent body of clear glass (bating the umbilical&nbsp;55knot)&mdash;so that, till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of light, in passing through them, become so monstrously refracted,&mdash;&mdash;or return reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye, that a man cannot be seen through;&mdash;his soul might as well, unless for mere ceremony, or the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave her,&mdash;might, upon all other accounts, I&nbsp;say, as well play the fool out o&rsquo;doors as in her own house.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c2">But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of this earth;&mdash;our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapt up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood;

Indeed, the gait and figure of him was so strange, and so utterly unlike was he, from his head to his tail, to any one of the whole species, that it was now and then made a matter of dispute,&mdash;&mdash;whether he was really a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">Hobby-Horse</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or no: but as the Philosopher would use no other argument to the Sceptic, who disputed with him against the reality of motion, save that of rising up upon his legs, and walking across the room;&mdash;so would my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;use no other argument to prove his&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">Hobby-Horse</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">Hobby-Horse</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;indeed, but by getting upon his back and riding him about;&mdash;leaving the world, after that, to determine the point as it thought fit.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">In good truth, my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mounted him with so much pleasure, and he carried my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;so well,&mdash;&mdash;that he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or thought about&nbsp;it.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of him:&mdash;But to go on regularly, I&nbsp;only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first, how my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;came by him.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.htkyprw89ywj"><span class="c7 c2">CHAPTER XXV</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c4">The</span><span class="c0 c4">&nbsp;wound</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;groin, which he received at the siege of&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Namur</span><span class="c0">, rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought expedient he should return to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">England</span><span class="c0 c2">, in order, if possible, to be set to rights.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">He was four years totally confined,&mdash;part of it to his bed, and all of it to his room: and in the course of his cure, which was all that time in hand, suffer&rsquo;d unspeakable miseries,&mdash;owing to a succession of exfoliations from the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">os pubis</span><span class="c0">, and the outward edge of that part of the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">coxendix</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;called the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">os illium</span><span class="c0">,&mdash;&mdash;both which bones were dismally crush&rsquo;d, as much by the irregularity of the stone, which I told you was broke off the parapet,&mdash;as by its size,&mdash;(tho&rsquo;

and my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;received great relief from them, and would have received much more, but that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities, which, for three months together, retarded his cure greatly; and if he had not hit upon an expedient to extricate himself out of them, I&nbsp;verily believe they would have laid him in his grave.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0">What these perplexities of my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Toby</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;were,&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;tis impossible for you to guess;&mdash;if you could</span><span class="c0 c4">,&mdash;I&nbsp;should blush;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;not as a relation,&mdash;not as a man,&mdash;nor even as a woman,&mdash;but I should blush as an author;
